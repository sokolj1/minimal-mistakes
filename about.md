I'm a Data Scientist at AtlantiCare Health System and Adjunct Professor of Business at Stockton University.

## Background
I graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to the field of computer science with Java as an undergraduate shifted my interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After considerable research into data science, I applied and was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at my undergraduate alma mater, and graduated in August 2018 with _Summa Cum Laude_ honors.

## Professional Experience
I began an internship at AtlantiCare Health System in March 2018 working in Data Analytics, manipulating data models and creating Tableau dashboards for the quality department. After graduation, I was hired as a Data Solutions Architect, currently working on a project for the Cardiovascular Service Line.

I am also continuing my academic career as Adjunct Professor of Business at Stockton University, teaching MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization for Fall 2018 and Spring 2019. I am excited to teach storytelling with data by means of coherent, organized and interactive graphics.

Besides munging datasets, building awesome visualizations, and tuning machine learning models, other things I enjoy are spending time with my family, photography, unique culinary experiences, and running, tennis, biking, and lifting.
