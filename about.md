# Background: 
Although I have established a career in data science, I have a well rounded academic background. I graduated Stockton University with a BS in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor with _cum laude_ honors in May 2017. Exposure to the field of computer science and programming shifted my interests from the physical sciences to mathematics and software development as an undergraduate. One thing led to another, and I eventually learned about data science. I want to have a _strong_ command of this rapidly developing field, so I decided my alma mater was the perfect place to pursue graduate study in Data Science & Strategic Analytics. I am on track to graduate with a Master of Science degree in August 2018. 

Other things in life I enjoy are family, photography, and physical activity (running, biking, and lifting).
