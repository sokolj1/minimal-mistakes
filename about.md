John Sokol is a Data Solutions Architect at AtlantiCare Health System and an Adjunct Professor of Business at Stockton University.

## Background
John graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to computer science using Java as an undergraduate shifted his interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After considerable research into data science, he was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at his undergraduate alma mater, and graduated in August 2018.

## Professional Experience
John began an internship at AtlantiCare Health System in March 2018, manipulating data models and creating Tableau dashboards as an integral asset for the business intelligence and analytics department. After graduation, he was hired as a Data Solutions Architect.

John also teaches MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization, where undergraduate business analytics students learn data storytelling by means of coherent, organized and interactive visualizations.
