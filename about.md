Hello! My name is John Sokol. I am a Data Solutions Architect at AtlantiCare Health and an Adjunct faculty member at Stockton University.

## Background
I graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to computer science using Java as an undergraduate shifted my interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After research into the field of data science, I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at my undergraduate alma mater, and graduated August 2018.

## Professional Experience
I began an internship at AtlantiCare Health System in March 2018, manipulating data models and creating Tableau dashboards as an integral asset for the business intelligence and analytics department. Shortly after graduation, I was hired as a Data Solutions Architect.

I also teach MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization for undergraduate business analytics students to learn data storytelling by means of coherent, organized and interactive visualizations.

In his spare time, I enjoy spending time with family, photography, unique food experiences, running, tennis, biking, and lifting.
