Hello! My name is John Sokol. I am a Marketing Data Analyst at NewLane Finance in Philadelphia and an adjunct faculty member at Stockton University in Galloway, NJ.

## Background
I graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to computer science using Java as an undergraduate shifted my interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After research into the field of data science, I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at my undergraduate alma mater, and graduated August 2018.

## Professional Experience
I was hired as a Marketing Data Analyst in April 2019 responsible for lead generation, lead quality assessment, and business intelligence and analytics for NewLane Finance, an equipment lease and finance company.

I also teach MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization and GNM 2256 - Designing Graphs Seeing Numbers for undergraduate business analytics students to learn data storytelling by means of coherent, organized and interactive visualizations.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with family, photography, unique food experiences, running, tennis, biking, and lifting.
