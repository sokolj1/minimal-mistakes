John Sokol is a Data Scientist at AtlantiCare Health System and holds an adjunct role as a business professor at Stockton University.

## Background
John graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to computer science using Java as an undergraduate shifted his interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After considerable research into data science, he was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at his undergraduate alma mater, and graduated in August 2018.

## Professional Experience
John began an internship at AtlantiCare Health System in March 2018, manipulating data models and creating Tableau dashboards for the quality department. After graduation, he was hired as a Data Solutions Architect, and currently works on a project for the Cardiovascular Service Line.

John also teaches MGMT 3125 - Introduction to Data Visualization, where undergraduate business analytics students learn the art of data storytelling by means of coherent, organized and interactive visualizations.

Now that Tuesday nights are free, John plans to become an active participant in the [DataPhilly](https://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) meetup group. They faciliated the DataJawn conference in June 2018, which was an excellent event about applied data science in healthcare and networking with other data scientists.
