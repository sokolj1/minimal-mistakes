I'm a Data Analytics Intern at AtlantiCare Health System and a graduate of Stockton University's [Data Science & Strategic Analytics program](https://stockton.edu/graduate/data-science_strategic-analytics.html).

## Background: 
I graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor with _cum laude_ honors in May 2017. Exposure to the field of computer science with Java as an undergraduate shifted my interests from the natural sciences to applications of data with computer programming. After considerable research into data science, I applied and was accepted into the Master of Science in Data Science & Strategic Analytics program at my undergraduate alma mater, and graduated in August 2018.  

Besides munging datasets, other things I enjoy are spending time with my family, photography, unique culinary experiences, and running, tennis, biking, and lifting.
