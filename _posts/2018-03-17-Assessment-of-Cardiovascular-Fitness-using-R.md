## Data Exploration Final Project for Fall 2017

From September 21, 2017 to November 21, 2017, I meticulously tracked my sleep and exercise habits. Additionally, I tracked several health metrics associated with good cardiovascular health, all using an Apple Watch Series 2. Although sample sizes were small, the data holistically suggests I experienced increased cardiovascular fitness over the course of the 9 week test period. 

Here is the link to the [final report](https://sokolj.com/assets/cardiovasuclar_fitness/Sokol_DE__Project_Final.1.7.2018.pdf) as well as the [.rmd](https://sokolj.com/assets/cardiovasuclar_fitness/Sokol_DE_Project_Final.1.8.2018.Rmd) file for this project.
