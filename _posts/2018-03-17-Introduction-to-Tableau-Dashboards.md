## This powerful interactive software can be leveraged in the healthcare industry to reduce costs, enhance quality, and improve the patient experience

For the data scientist unfamilar with business intelligence, [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is an interactive data visualization software/technology that faciliates obtaining valuable insights from data. Although Tableau Desktop and Enterprise are not open source (students may download Tableau desktop for [free](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students)), Tableau Public is a free service that lets anyone create a workbook and publish "vizzes" to webpages and blogs. Tableau public is a great opportunity for data scientists to understand their data from a visual perspective and share those findings. This blog post will focus on exploring data's impact on the healthcare industry using Tableau. 

According to [Tom Dewar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR95OZ32DTU), Head of Information at St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust in London, Tableau is helping hospitals convert information into insight and improve patient outcomes. 

>"Ultimately we're all about patient care; we all work in a hospital because we want the best care and experience for our patients in a very difficult time for them. Tableau allows us to focus more on these things, and less on other things" - Tom Dewar
