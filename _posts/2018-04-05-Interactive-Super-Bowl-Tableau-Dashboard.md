## Dashboard visualization of Super Bowl XLVI - LII showing play by play win probabilities and play descriptions

As a lifelong Giants fan, it was painful to watch the Philadelphia Eagles win their first championship 
since 1960, and their first Super Bowl victory in the history of the franchise, on February 4th, 2018. Gone are the days
of using the default end all argument with the hypothetical question “How many Super Bowl rings do the Eagles have?” 
The idea is anathema to any Giants fan and any football fan that has a disdain for the birdgang (Cowboys, Redskins, Patriots, etc). 

But as someone who has a love for the game of Football, Super Bowl LII was an incredibly entertaining matchup that set several precedents, such as: 
- 1,151 total offensive yardage, more than 200 yards more than any previous Super Bowl
- 


After watching the highlight reel and hearing these facts, I wanted to dive deeper into this Super Bowl. I wanted to see the pivotal turning points in the game, and how these plays affected both teams chances of winning the game at the given moment.
