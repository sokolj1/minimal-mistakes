Throughout a career, the data scientist will communicate various findings and insights to a variety of audiences, from stakeholders within an organization to hundreds of people at a public conference. The topic is so important that a 6 week accelerated summer course is dedicated to the study of communicative practices for Stockton University's Data Science program.

The book used as the primary resource for course material is Randy Olsen's _Houston, We Have a Narrative_. A link to purchase can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Houston-We-Have-Narrative-Science/dp/022627084X) for about $15 paperback on Amazon. The author is [Scientist-turned filmmaker](http://www.randyolsonproductions.com/randy_olson/randy_olson_index.html) Randy Olsen, not [Life Epigenetics AI researcher](http://www.randalolson.com) Randy Olsen. 

The goals of the course were to learn how to develop an argument with data science techniques, share ideas and knowledge with diverse audiences, and formulate a balanced perspective on an issue or topic from the field of data science. This post focuses on accomplishing these objectives by means of sound narrative structure, which ultimately develops narrative intuition.

## Science and Communication: Where the Problem Lies

Oslen's book posits scientists are prone to experience _narrative deficiency_: an insufficent understanding of narrative, or not knowing how to apply the power of storytelling to their scientific work. Let's identify a few issues in the science community that can be potentially mitigated with adopting narrative intuition.

Academic institutions that measure competency for faculty and graduate students by quantity of published papers are inadvertently creating a toxic environment of publish or perish. [John Ioannidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis), Professor of Medicine and of Health Research and Policy at Stanford University, stated "Most of the claimed statistically significant effects in traditional medical research are false positives or substantially exaggerated." This may be attributed to pressure to publish positive studies and the public shaming of null studies. In reality, the success of a paper is _not_ about the story itself, but *how the story is told*. 

All of these issues are derived from the inability to successfully tell a story. For papers that exemplify lack of narrative understanding, the author may repeat fact after fact with no sense of context. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there could be multiple issues occurring; there are so many key turning points in the paper that the main message is lost in complexity. There is an optimum amount of narrative complexion balanced simultanously with simplicity that must be determined by the data scientist; enough complextion to be engaging, not confusing, and simplistic enough for the desired audience, not boring. Thus it is my hope that the following content drives home these key ideas so everyone, not just scientists, can develop narrative intuition in their own work.

<!-- I believe these issues are prevalent in science, and also other domains as well, because higher education focuses on learning the required content to a fault. It is rare for institutions to explicitly teach scientific communication, so there is a large deficiency of liberal arts communicative knowledge. It is my hope that the following content drives home several key points to allay these concerns. -->

## Narrative Structure

Olsen gives special importance to a call to action for scientists to develop _story sense_, or narrative intuition, which like most things in life, require practice before mastery is obtained. An effective way to develop narrative intuition is to prioritize narrative structure by using the [Dobzhansky Template](#dobzhansky-template), [And, But Therefore](#and-but-therefore), and [The Hero's Journey](#the-hero's-journey)

### Dobzhansky Template

Theodosius Dobzhansky was a famous geneticist who said one of the most important statements in biological philosophy: 

> "Nothing in biology makes sense _except_ in the light of evolution." 

This statement encapsules biology in context of evolution, which is the overarching narrative telling the story of how  different facets of biology, such as biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics, are tied together by the concept of evolution. 

In the same regard, this quote by Dobzhansky can be applied to any topic by making the template generic: 

Nothing in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ makes sense _except_ in the light of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.


This template helps the data scientist find a central theme that embraces the heart and soul of the narrative. Finding the right words, especially for the second blank, takes practice and effort. If you are just lukewarm after proposing a plausible word, most likely there is a better word that will serve as the foundation for your story.

Here are a few other examples of the Dobzhansky template in action: 

1. Apple: Nothing in Apple Computers makes sense _except_ in the light of innovation. 

2. Wawa: Nothing in Wawa makes sense _except_ in the light of convenience ([Don't know what a Wawa is?](https://www.wawa.com)) 

3. Communication: Nothing in communication makes sense _except_ in the light of simplicity. 

Perhaps most important is Dobzhansky's comments regarding a story that lack a central theme/focus: 

> Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry factsâ€”some of them interesting or curious but making no meaningful picture as a whole.

For this post, a solid Dobzhansky statement would be:

Nothing about **communication** makes sense except in the light of **simplicity** and **structure**.

During the brainstorming stages of a project, devote some time to thinking about an ideal Dobzansky template to create a meaningful picture for your story. 

### And, But, Therefore

The And, But, Therefore (ABT) narrative structure is considered the "DNA of story" that serves to organize the writer's thoughts in a concise and compelling manner. ABT is the crux of any story. It is the essential components of the narrative that need to be conveyed so that the reader understands what is happening. The structure of ABT is the following: 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, therefore \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 


Here is an example of ABT applied to The Wizard of Oz:

> There is a little girl living on a farm in Kansas, **and** her life is boring, **but** one day a tornado sweeps her away to the land of Oz, **therefore** she must undertake a journey to find her way home. 

Simple, concise, and gets the main message of the movie across. Extremely powerful. Once you create this  template for a PowerPoint presentation for your day job or a semester long research paper, it is easy to reference your ABT template as a roadmap to a single cohesive idea that you want the audience to take away from your findings. 

The ABT follows the traditional three act play structure: beginning (thesis), middle (antithesis), and end (synthesis). The 'And' component establishes the situation, the 'But' establishes the conflict, and the 'Therefore' resolves the conflict. Olsen is credited for coining this template as 'ABT', this narrative structure has actually been intertwined with story for centuries. Although Olsen frequently bashes modern day scientists in his book, he acknowledges the communicative storytelling gifts of Watson and Crick, codiscoverers of the DNA molecule. It turns out they used the ABT framework with their landmark paper _Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids_:

### "The Hero's Journey" Narrative

The Hero's Journey template is the following: 

1. In an ordinary world

2. A flawed protagonist

3. Has a catalytic event that upends world

4. After taking stock

5. The hero commits to action

6. But when the stakes get raised

7. The protagonist must learn the lesson. 

8. To stop the antagonist

9. And achieve the goal

McKee's Triangle sheds light on how different types of narrative play into audience perception and engagement.



## Extra Storytelling Tips

* The power of storytelling rests in specifics, as the human mind tends to default towards generalities. 

* Narrative benefits the storyteller because it activates the brain and unifies the thinking of the audience.

* Strive for short, succient titles.

* The two worst possible ways communication can go wrong are boring and/or confusing interpretations. 

> "Truths can not walk on their own legs" - Karlyn Campbell. Truths must be explained, defended, and spread through language, argument, and appeal. 

* Sending theh narrative off is a great thing, but only _once_, and utilize a singular narrative, as more than one is confusing. 

* When creating narrative content, capture the "inner monologue", as nobody wants to listen to a person with no emotions.
