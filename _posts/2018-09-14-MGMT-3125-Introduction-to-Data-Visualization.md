## Course Information

### Description:

Introduction to Data Visualization provides an overview of business analytics, including the process of business analytics / business intelligence analysis, big data management, and principles of data visualization and dashboard design. The course uses spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets) and Tableau.

This is the first course with a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts and tools of business analytics for improving business decision making and performance. This is a hands-on course that is designed to introduce the principles and techniques for data visualization. Visualizations are graphical depictions of data that can improve comprehension, communication, and decision making. Students will learn visual representation methods and techniques that increase the understanding of complex data and models. Emphasis is placed on the identification of patterns, trends and differences from data sets across categories, space, and time. 

### Prerequisites

* CSIS 1206 (Statistics) with a letter grade of C or better.

* General computer skills and familiarity. An understanding of basic charting and statistical terms/practices will be helpful, but not required.

### Textbook

## Week 1 - 9/10

### Notes from Storytelling with Data, Chapter 1: The Importance of Context Before Building the Visualization

#### Exploratory vs. Explanatory analysis
*	Ex_plor_atory - understand the data to determine what may be noteworthy to show the audience
* Ex_plan_atory - Specific story about the data to tell

Too often the visualization author shows the exploratory analysis instead of simply the important facets of the study the audience cares about.

#### The Who, What and How of Context

Who: Very important to understand the intended audience and how they perceive you. This will shape how you approach creating the visualization. 

* The Who aspect helps to identify common ground that will facilitate relaying your findings to that audience
* The more specific identification of the audience, the better. Just saying clients/key stakeholders usually isn't specific enough 

What: What do you need your audience to know? 

* Should be clear how you want your audience to react
* Take into account overall tone of visualization and/or presentation
* If you are the one analyzing and communicating the data, you are considered the 'subject matter expert'
* Be confident with your findings! Don't let fear of public speaking decrease your credibility

How: Mechanism of conveying the information
* Live presentations should have a paucity of detail considering you're available to answer questions
* Write ups/static documents demand generous detail to cover all the bases for possible client/stakeholder questions

#### The Big Idea

A single sentence summary of the study background information, issue the study is trying to solve, and the outcome of the study. Three components of The Big Idea:

* The idea must articulate your unique point of view
* The idea must convey what is at stake
* The idea must be a complete sentence

#### Storyboarding

Very powerful way of organizing ideas by creating a visual outline for the content of the visualization.

* Our minds do not think linearly; our minds scatter our thoughts. Time and effort must be put forth to organize them properly.
* A few pieces of paper and pen just fine for this task. Alternatively, if you have a Mac or iOS software, I recommend [MindNode](https://mindnode.com)
