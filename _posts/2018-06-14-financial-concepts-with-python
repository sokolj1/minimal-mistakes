Summer classes are over, which means now I have time to organize my grad school notes for shareability
and posterity. This will be the first of several posts about various topics I learned from fall 2017 
through summer 2018. The first topic involves financial analysis with Python as part of the DataCamp course 
used as a soft introduction to Python.
