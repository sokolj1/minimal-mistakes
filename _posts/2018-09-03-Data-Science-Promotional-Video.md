Shawn Casler and I created a promotional video using Final Cut Pro for the Data Science & Strategic Analytics program. The one minute video defines the field of data science, shows learned data science skills advancing traditional marine biology, and attests the data science program enables career upward mobility.

The self-standing Master's degree consists of 30 credit hours (10 graduate courses) that can be completed in full time or part time study. Full-time study is the preferred route and in this mode the degree may be completed in one calendar year. The courses are hybrid, with weekly meeting times on Tuesdays from 6:00pm - 9:00pm and an online learning environment.
