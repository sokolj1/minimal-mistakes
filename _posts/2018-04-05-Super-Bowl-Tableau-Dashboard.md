## Dashboard visualization of Super Bowl 46 - 52 depicting play by play win probabilities of each game

As a lifelong Giants fan, it was painful to watch the Philadelphia Eagles win their first championship 
since 1960, and their first Super Bowl victory in the history of the franchise. Oh well, gone are the days
of using the default end all argument with the hypothetical question “How many Super Bowl rings do the Eagles have?” 
It makes me sick to my stomach.

Although the Eagles are not my favorite NFL team in the world (ranked 31/32 of my favorite teams right in front of Dallas),
from an objective standpoint, the Philadelphia Eagles performed at an outstanding level this past season. They ended the 
season with a 13-3 win/loss record. The birdgang also cliched the NFC East division title by week 14, but this seemed like 
a pyrric victory with the loss of QB Carson Wentz to a torn ACL and LCL. With backup quarterback Nick Foles now at the helm, 
even the media inside the city of Philadelphia wrote this team off as possibly losing the divisional round game. As for the 
fans of the other 31 NFL teams, they doubted the Eagle's ability to sustain their level of success.
