Summer classes are over, which means now I have time to organize my grad school notes for shareability
and posterity. This will be the first of several posts about various topics I learned from fall 2017 
through summer 2018. The first topic involves financial analysis with Python as part of the DataCamp course 
used as a soft introduction to Python.

## The Time Value of Money

### Calculating Return on Investment (% Gain)

Return on investment is the ratio between the net profit and initial cost of investment. Mathematically: 

$$Return(\% Gain) = \large \frac{v_2 - v_1}{v_1}$$

where 

$$v_1$$: initial value of the investment at time

$$v_2$$: final value of the investment at time

The cumulative returns from investing $100 in an asset that grows at 5% per year, over a 2 year period can be calculated in Python as: 

{% highlight python %}

future_value = 100 * (1 + 0.06)**30
print("Future Value of Investment: " + str(round(future_value, 2)))

# Future Value of Investment: 574.35

{% endhighlight %}

### Cumulative Growth

This metric tracks the value of an investment that consistently experiences growth or depreciation. 

$$Investment Value = \large \v_0 * (1 + r)^{t}}$$

where

$$r$$: The investmentâ€™s expected rate of return (growth rate)

$$t$$: The lifespan of the investment (time) 

$$v_0$$: The initial value of the investment at time 0
