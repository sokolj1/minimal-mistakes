# Understanding the linearly separable binary classifier from the ground up using R

The perceptron. It has become a rite of passage for comprehending the underlying mechanism of neural networks, and machine learning as a whole. The algorithm was invented in 1957 at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory by Frank Rosenblatt with funding from the US government [1](http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fh0042519). The concept behind the perceptron is simple: separate two distinct categories of data based on linear separability. For instance,
