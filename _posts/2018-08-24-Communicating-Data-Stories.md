This post is about essential communicative skills that a data scientist should understand to 
effectively convey his or her findings. The topic is so important that a 6 week accelerated 
course is dedicated to this study with 'Communicating Data Stories'. The course description is the following: 

> Creating a narrative with data. Covers selection, refinement, analysis and visualization with data,
as well as data journalism, data rhetoric, and modes of communication.

The goals of the course are to learn how to develop an argument with data science techniques, share ideas and knowledge with diverse audiences, and formulate a balanced perspective on an issue or topic from the field of data science. 

The book used as the primary resource for course material is Randy Olsen's Houston, We Have a Narrative. A link to purchase can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Houston-We-Have-Narrative-Science/dp/022627084X) for about $15 paperback on Amazon. The author is [Scientist-turned filmmaker](http://www.randyolsonproductions.com/randy_olson/randy_olson_index.html) Randy Olsen, not [Life Epigenetics AI researcher](http://www.randalolson.com) Randy Olsen.

## Science and Communication: Where the Problem Lies

The course and book revolves around the notion that most scientists experience _narrative deficiency_: an insufficent understanding of narrative, or not knowing how to apply the power of storytelling to their scientific work. First, let's identify notable issues in the scientific community that can be mitigated by narrative understanding.

Academic institutions who measure competency for faculty and graduate students by quantity of published papers are inadvertently creating a toxic environment of publish or perish. [John Ioannidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis), Professor of Medicine and of Health Research and Policy at Stanford University, stated "Most of the claimed statistically significant effects in traditional medical research are false positives or substantially exaggerated." This may be attributed to pressure to publish positive studies and the public shaming of null studies. In reality, the success of a paper is _not_ about the story itself, but *how the story is told*. 

This next issue in science goes back to the inability to successfully grasp how to tell a story. For papers that clearly have a lack of narrative understanding, they may simply repeat fact after fact with no overall sense of context. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there could be multiple issues occurring, or multiple key turning points in the paper that the main message of the paper is lost in complexity. I believe these issues are prevalent in science, and also other domains as well, because higher education emphasizes learning the required content to a fault. Very few institutions teach how to communicate scientific understanding. Hopefully this post drives home several key points to help allay these concerns in the future.
