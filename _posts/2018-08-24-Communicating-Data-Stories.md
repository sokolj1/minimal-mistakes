The data scientist needs a strong comprehension of communicating various findings and insights to a wide variety of audiences, from key stakeholders within an organization to hundreds at a public conference. The topic is so important that a 6 week accelerated summer course is dedicated to the study of communicative practices for Stockton University's Data Science program. The course description is the following: 

> Creating a narrative with data. Covers selection, refinement, analysis and visualization with data,
as well as data journalism, data rhetoric, and modes of communication.

The goals of the course are to learn how to develop an argument with data science techniques, share ideas and knowledge with diverse audiences, and formulate a balanced perspective on an issue or topic from the field of data science. 

The book used as the primary resource for course material is Randy Olsen's Houston, We Have a Narrative. A link to purchase can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/Houston-We-Have-Narrative-Science/dp/022627084X) for about $15 paperback on Amazon. The author is [Scientist-turned filmmaker](http://www.randyolsonproductions.com/randy_olson/randy_olson_index.html) Randy Olsen, not [Life Epigenetics AI researcher](http://www.randalolson.com) Randy Olsen.

## Science and Communication: Where the Problem Lies

The course and book revolves around the notion that most scientists experience _narrative deficiency_: an insufficent understanding of narrative, or not knowing how to apply the power of storytelling to their scientific work. First, let's identify notable issues in the scientific community that can be mitigated by narrative understanding.

Academic institutions that measure competency for faculty and graduate students by quantity of published papers are inadvertently creating a toxic environment of publish or perish. [John Ioannidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ioannidis), Professor of Medicine and of Health Research and Policy at Stanford University, stated "Most of the claimed statistically significant effects in traditional medical research are false positives or substantially exaggerated." This may be attributed to pressure to publish positive studies and the public shaming of null studies. In reality, the success of a paper is _not_ about the story itself, but *how the story is told*. 

This next issue in science goes back to the inability to successfully grasp how to tell a story. For papers that clearly have a lack of narrative understanding, they may simply repeat fact after fact with no overall sense of context. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there could be multiple issues occurring, or several key turning points in the paper that the main message is lost in complexity. There is an optimum amount of narrative complexion balanced simultanously with simplicity that must be determined by the data scientist; enough complextion to be engaging, not confusing, and simplistic enough for the desired audience, not boring. 

I believe these issues are prevalent in science, and also other domains as well, because higher education focuses on learning the required content to a fault. It is rare for institutions to explicitly teach scientific communication, so there is a large deficient of liberal arts communicative knowledge. It is my hope that the following content drives home several key points to allay these concerns.

## The Foundation of Narrative Structure

Olsen gives special importance to a call to action for scientists to develop _story sense_, or narrative intuition, which like most things in life, require practice before mastery is obtained. An effective technique to develop narrative intuition is to create a Dobzhansky Template and use the And, But, Therefore (ABT) formatting structure. 

### Dobzhansky Template

Theodosius Dobzhansky was a famous geneticist who said one of the most important statements in biological philosophy: 

> "Nothing in biology makes sense _except_ in the light of evolution." 

This statement encapsules biology in context of evolution, which is the overarching narrative telling the story of how  different facets of biology, such as biochemistry, microbiology, and genetics, are tied together by the concept of evolution. 

In the same regard, this quote by Dobzhansky can be applied to any topic by making the template generic: 

Nothing in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ makes sense _except_ in the light of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.


This template helps the data scientist find a central theme that embraces the heart and soul of the narrative. Finding the right words, especially for the second blank, takes practice and effort. If you are just lukewarm after proposing a plausible word, most likely there is a better word that will serve as the foundation for your story. Here are a few other examples of the Dobzhansky template in action: 

1. Apple: Nothing in Apple Computers makes sense _except_ in the light of innovation. 

2. Wawa: Nothing in Wawa makes sense _except_ in the light of convenience ([Don't know what a Wawa is?](https://www.wawa.com)) 

3. Communication: Nothing in communication makes sense _except_ in the light of simplicity. 

Perhaps most important is Dobzhansky's comments regarding a story that lack a central theme/focus: 

> Without that light, it becomes a pile of sundry factsâ€”some of them interesting or curious but making no meaningful picture as a whole.

During the brainstorming stages of a project, devote some time to thinking about an ideal Dobzansky template to create a meaningful picture for your story. 

### And, But, Therefore

The And, But, Therefore (ABT) narrative structure is considered the "DNA of story" that serves to organize the writer's thoughts in a concise and compelling manner. ABT is the crux of any story. It is the essential components of the narrative that need to be conveyed so that the reader understands what is happening. The structure of ABT is the following: 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, but \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, therefore \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. 


Here is an example of ABT applied to The Wizard of Oz:

> There is a little girl living on a farm in Kansas, **and** her life is boring, **but** one day a tornado sweeps her away to the land of Oz, **therefore** she must undertake a journey to find her way home. 

Simple, concise, and gets the main message of the movie across. Extremely powerful. Once you create this  template for a PowerPoint presentation for your day job or a semester long research paper, it is easy to reference your ABT template as a roadmap to a single cohesive idea that you want the audience to take away from your findings. 

The ABT follows the traditional three act play structure: beginning (thesis), middle (antithesis), and end (synthesis). The 'And' component establishes the situation, the 'But' establishes the conflict, and the 'Therefore' resolves the conflict. Olsen is credited for coining this template as 'ABT', this narrative structure has actually been intertwined with story for centuries. Although Olsen frequently bashes modern day scientists in his book, he acknowledges the communicative storytelling gifts of Watson and Crick, codiscoverers of the DNA molecule. It turns out they used the ABT framework with their landmark paper _Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids_:
